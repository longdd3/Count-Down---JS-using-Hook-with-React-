# Count-Down---JS-using-Hook-with-React-
The objective of Countdown Timer is to provide a continuously decrementing display of the days, hours, minutes, and seconds to a user entered event.
Use only builtin language functions for your calculations rather than relying on a library or package like MomentJS. This assumes, of course, that the language of your choice has adequate date and time manipulation functions built in.


User can see the elements in the countdown timer automatically decrement. For example, when the remaining seconds count reaches 0 the remaining minutes count will decrement by 1 and the seconds will start to countdown from 59. This progression must take place from seconds all the way up to the remaining days position in countdown display.
User can enter the date in JS and change the date format to the new value
